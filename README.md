Pulsar Software Runner

So I made up my mind to create this simple project for running the Pulsar Software that I developed for just like 15 minutes (lol) 
because I'm a bit annoyed turning back the time just to open the Software since as of the moment it has issue because of Date. (Damn devs, pls release a new version :( )

What this does is just it turns back the time to the year 2022 so the Pulsar Software can be opened and then resync the time to the current Date of your country.

You can either rebuild this project if you're suspicious of the exe file or just download the exe from the Releases.
This is built using .net Framework 4.7.2

So how to make sure that this will run?
1. Check if you have the shortcut file of Pulsar Software on your desktop exactly named "Pulsar Fusion Wireless Mice". 
   If there's none, then just create one.
2. Run as administrator the exe file and it will automatically open the Pulsar Software.
